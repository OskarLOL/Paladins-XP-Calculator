# Paladins-XP-Calculator
A Basic Calculator to find out how much grind it would take to get to a specific level.

You can use this Python script for whatever you want to use it for i do not care if u just copy paste it anywhere because i wrote it in like 30 minutes so yeah.
Enjoy this kinda useless Calculator
